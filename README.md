# Listit

My first GUI App. A simple Python GUI application that allows you to manage your todos. Made by dearpygui.

Supports saving a todo-list and loading it again.

## How to use

Download this repo as a zip from GitHub, decompress it, and run listit.py.

(Note that saving your todo-list requires reading/writing/creating a new txt file, which will be created in your current directory. Make sure to run the script in a parent directory that contains the txt file.
In VS Code, this can be done by opening the decompressed folder as a workspace, then running listit.py)

**Pls star!!!**
