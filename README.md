# Listit

My first GUI App. A simple Python GUI application that allows you to manage your todos. Made by dearpygui.

Supports saving a todo-list, loading it again, changing fonts, and more!

## How to use

Download this repo as a zip from GitHub, decompress it, and run listit.py.

(Note that saving your todo-list requires reading/writing/creating a new txt file, which will be created in your current directory. Make sure to run the script in a parent directory that contains the txt file.
In VS Code, this can be done by opening the decompressed folder as a workspace, then running listit.py)

Two fonts are set by default, one is the default font used by Dearpygui, one is Aptos. You can move your own font files in the directory of the script, and add the font file in the font list in listit.py
